This provides a streaming version of the InsightToolkit class
ResampleImageFilter.

Warning: This class should only be used when the transformed associated with the
object is linear or at least behaves linearly in the direction(s) that are
streamed.  Otherwise, the results may not be correct.

This class inherits from ResampleImageFilter, so the behavior is the same apart
from sending the RequestedRegion upstream instead of requiring the input to
update the LargestPossibleRegion for any RequestedRegion.
